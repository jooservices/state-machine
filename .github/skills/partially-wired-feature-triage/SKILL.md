# Partially Wired Feature Triage Skill

## Purpose

This skill gives agents a safe response pattern for features that exist in code but are not fully supported in runtime behavior.

## Known partially wired / placeholder features

- `Computed` (deprecated placeholder; use `ComputesLazyProperties`)
- `Deprecated` (deprecated placeholder; no runtime warnings)
- `OptionalProperty` (deprecated documentation-only marker)
- `Context::$transformerMode` (reserved; not behavior-defining)

## Features no longer in triage-only status

- Property-level `#[Pipeline]` runs before validation and casting during hydration
- `Context::$globalPipeline` runs global steps before property-level `#[Pipeline]` during hydration
- `#[StrictType]` enforces strict per-property casting
- `#[DefaultFrom]` provides hydration fallback values from env, config, and supported static methods
- Class-level `#[DiscriminatorMap]` resolves discriminator-based subtype hydration
- Common PHPDoc typed arrays are inferred into runtime metadata for hydration and schema generation
- `Data::update()` and `Data::set()` rebuild through hydration instead of bypassing runtime rules
- `CastWith` / `TransformWith` options are constructor-spread arguments (`new Class(...$options)`)

## Triage options

### Option 1: Document the limitation

Use when the task is docs, review, or support guidance and no runtime implementation is requested.

### Option 2: Offer a supported workaround

Prefer:

- `transformInput()`
- `afterHydration()`
- custom casters
- custom transformers
- surrounding application services

### Option 3: Implement the runtime wiring explicitly

Only do this when the task actually asks for new runtime support and you can also add tests and docs.

## Response rules for agents

- State clearly that the feature is declared but not fully integrated today
- Do not imply existing support because an attribute class exists
- If implementing support, update runtime code, tests, and docs together

## Definition of done

- The agent responds truthfully about support status
- Users get either a safe workaround or a real implementation path
